# LhscFhirServer: Status Recap and Next Steps

This document summarizes the current state of the `LhscFhirServer` project and outlines the plan for completing its development and integrating it into the MasterEHR ecosystem.

## âœ… **Recap: What We Have Done**

We have successfully built the core foundation of a custom FHIR server, a significant technical achievement.

* **1. Project Foundation:** A complete Spring Boot project has been created with all the necessary dependencies for a FHIR server (`hapi-fhir-server`) and a database connection (`spring-data-jpa`, `mssql-jdbc`).

* **2. Live Database Connection:** The application is successfully configured to connect to your live `LHSCDB` database running on your Azure SQL Server VM. We have proven this connection works.

* **3. Data Mapping Layer (JPA):** We have created a `PatientEntity` class that perfectly represents the `Patients` table in your SQL database, and a `PatientRepository` that gives us the power to query that table.

* **4. FHIR "Read" Operation:** The most critical piece is complete. We have implemented a `PatientProvider` that can:
    * Receive an HTTP request for a specific patient (e.g., `GET /fhir/Patient/1`).
    * Use the repository to fetch that patient's data from the SQL database.
    * **Translate** the raw SQL data into a standard, official HL7 FHIR `Patient` resource.
    * Return that FHIR resource as a correctly formatted JSON response.

**In short: You have successfully built a "FHIR Facade" that can serve live patient data from your legacy SQL database.**

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps for `LhscFhirServer`**

Our server can currently only read one patient at a time. The next steps are to implement the full set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to make it a fully functional and realistic FHIR server.

### 1. **Implement FHIR Search (`@Search`)**

* **Goal:** Handle requests to search for patients, like `GET /fhir/Patient?family=Smith`.
* **Action:**
    * In the `PatientRepository` interface, define a new custom query method, like `List<PatientEntity> findByLastName(String lastName);`.
    * In the `PatientProvider` class, create a new method annotated with `@Search`.
    * This method will accept a `family` name parameter, call the new repository method to query the database, and then transform the *list* of results into a FHIR `Bundle` containing multiple `Patient` resources.

### 2. **Implement FHIR Create (`@Create`)**

* **Goal:** Handle requests to create a new patient, `POST /fhir/Patient`.
* **Action:**
    * In the `PatientProvider` class, create a new method annotated with `@Create`.
    * This method will receive a FHIR `Patient` resource in the request.
    * You will write a `transformToPatientEntity` helper method (the reverse of what we have now) to convert the incoming FHIR resource into a `PatientEntity` object.
    * You will then use `patientRepository.save()` to save that new entity to your SQL database.

### 3. **Implement FHIR Update (`@Update`)**

* **Goal:** Handle requests to update an existing patient, `PUT /fhir/Patient/1`.
* **Action:**
    * This is very similar to the `@Create` method. You will create a new method in `PatientProvider` annotated with `@Update`.
    * It will transform the incoming FHIR Patient into a `PatientEntity` and use `patientRepository.save()` to update the existing record in the database.

## ðŸ”— **How We Will Integrate Everything**

Once the `LhscFhirServer` has its full CRUD functionality, we will integrate it into our deployed system.

1.  **Deploy `LhscFhirServer`:**
    * First, we will deploy this new server to Render, just like we did for the `BackendFHIR` service. This will give it a public URL (e.g., `https://lhsc-fhir-server.onrender.com`).

2.  **Deploy a "Receiver" Server:**
    * To complete the transfer, we also need a receiver. We will deploy a generic HAPI FHIR server to Render (using a simple Dockerfile) and name it `sihc-fhir-server`. This will act as our temporary endpoint for St. Joseph's.

3.  **Reconfigure `BackendFHIR`:**
    * This is the final connection. We will go to the Render dashboard for our existing `BackendFHIR` application.
    * We will update its **Environment Variables**:
        * `FHIR_SERVER_SENDER_URL`: We will change this from a placeholder to the real URL of our new `LhscFhirServer`.
        * `FHIR_SERVER_RECEIVER_URL`: We will change this to the URL of our newly deployed `sihc-fhir-server`.
    * We will then re-deploy the `BackendFHIR` service.

After these steps, your `FrontendFHIR` application (with no code changes) will now trigger a transfer from your custom, SQL-backed `LhscFhirServer` to the `sihc-fhir-server`, completing the entire realistic workflow.
